# **TextSnip**

Take a screenshot and get the text **instantly** copied to your clipboard.  

TextSnip runs in the background, listens for your set **hotkey**, lets you take a screenshot, extracts text using **OCR**, and **copies** it to your clipboardâ€”ready for **Ctrl+V**. **Fast, simple, and efficient.**  

Currently only Windows version is available. MacOS in progress...
